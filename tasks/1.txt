make a new iOS app called CTC Car Traffic Control that lets drivers experience what airplane pilots get to do with ATC Air Traffic Control. It should ask the user for the make of their car (drop down with popular car makes) and the last few digits of their license plate. This will make their call sign like HONDA747 or JEEP901 that the user must start all communication with and end with. Also the tower will always address the user by their call sign too. The idea is to simulate the feeling of having to communicate carefully over the radio to a central place while driving. Please use iOS Text to Speech to generate the messages from the tower in a voice that sound kind of grainy like it has been transmitted over a radio and is not crystal clear. Also give the tower speaker the personality of a busy ATC worker. Just the facts. Also use iOS Speech to Text to listen to what the user is saying so the two way conversation can happen in real time. Use iOS location to know the GPS and street names the user is currently at. So the tower might say something like HONDA747 we see you approaching Sepulveda Blvd and Hammack Road hold short at red light. and the user would reply this is HONDA747 hold short at Sepulveda and Hammack HONDA747.
