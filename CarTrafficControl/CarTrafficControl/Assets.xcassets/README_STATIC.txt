For the radio static effect, you'll need to add an audio file named 'radio_static.mp3' to your project resources.

You can download a free radio static sound from sites like Freesound.org or create your own.

Once you have the audio file:
1. Add it to your Xcode project
2. Make sure it's included in the target
3. The app will automatically use it for the radio effect
